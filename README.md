# EPMS — Employee Payroll Management System

A lightweight, framework-free dashboard for browsing employee payroll data — search by name or ID, review deductions/incentives/allowances at a glance, and spot employees nearing retirement or recently hired.

Built with **TypeScript**, vanilla DOM APIs, and **Chart.js** — no frontend framework.

## Features

- 🔍 **Live search** — filter employees by name or ID number as you type, on button click, or by pressing Enter
- 💰 **Financial breakdown** — per-employee deductions, incentives, and allowances with amounts and reasons
- 📊 **Totals chart** — a Chart.js bar chart comparing total deductions vs. incentives vs. allowances across all employees
- 🧓 **Retirement tracking** — automatically flags employees at or above a configurable retirement age
- 🆕 **New hire tracking** — automatically flags employees hired within a configurable recent window
- 🎨 **Themed UI** — dark evergreen/lime palette with glass-panel cards, responsive CSS Grid layout

## Getting Started

### The Easiest way
To access the website directly [Click Here](https://mo-mahmoud-dev.github.io/EPMS/)

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for the TypeScript compiler)
- A local static server (the app uses `fetch()`, which requires `http://`, not `file://`)

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Install TypeScript (if you don't already have it)
npm install -g typescript

# 2. Compile the TypeScript source
tsc

# 3. Serve the project directory
npx serve .
# or: python -m http.server
```

Then open the local server URL in your browser (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`).

> **Note:** Opening `index.html` directly via `file://` will break the `fetch()` call that loads `employees.json` due to browser security restrictions. Always serve it through a local server.

## Data Model

Each employee record in `JSON/employees.json` follows this shape:

```ts
interface Employee {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  idNumber: string;
  salary: number;
  jobTitle: string;
  bankAccountNumber: string;
  statusDescription: string;
  deductions: { amount: number; reason: string }[];
  incentives: { amount: number; reason: string }[];
  allowances: { amount: number; reason: string }[];
  birthDate: string;   // ISO date, used for retirement calculation
  hireDate: string;    // ISO date, used for new-hire calculation
}
```

## Configuration

Retirement age and "new hire" window are configurable in `src/main.ts`:

```ts
const RETIREMENT_AGE = 60;      // years
const NEW_EMPLOYEE_DAYS = 90;   // days since hireDate
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Make retirement/new-hire thresholds configurable from the UI
- [ ] CSV export for filtered search results
- [ ] Pagination for large employee datasets
